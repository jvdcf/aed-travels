This project was carried out by students from group 23: Duarte Souto Assunção, Guilherme Duarte Silva Matos and João
Vítor da Costa Ferreira.

# Getting Started

The project was developed in C++ and uses the CMake tool to compile the source code and this documentation.

### Using the terminal

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release CMakeLists.txt
make
./AED2324_PRJ2_G23 //TODO
```

> **Warning:** Don't forget to **change the location of the csv files in the terminal commands**.  
> The commands above assume that the csv files are in the same directory as the executable.

> **Note:** Each flag indicates a file that must be passed as an argument to the program.
> //TODO

### Using CLion

1. Open the project folder in CLion.
2. Edit or add the configuration `AED2324_PRJ2_G23` with the correct program arguments and working directory.  
   For example:
    - Program arguments: //TODO
    - Working directory: `~/AED2324_PRJ2_G23`
3. Run the configuration.

# Notes

- //TODO
- The terminal embedded in CLion can behave a bit differently than the system's terminal.
  If possible, use the system's terminal to run the program.
- This program is tested for Linux only. As such, it only takes Linux-compatible CSV files on Linux. It might work on
  Windows, but that is untested.
